# DJS03 Project Brief: Book Connect - Abstractions

# Project Overview

- The "Book Connect" project provides an opportunity for students to refine a fully functional version of an application. I was tasked to enhance the code's maintainability, extendibility, and readability by applying concepts of objects and functions for abstraction.

# Project Brief

1. **Code Analysis**: Start by understanding the current implementation of the "Book Connect" application, including its HTML structure and JavaScript functionality.
2. **Plan Refactoring**: Identify sections of the code that can be made more abstract and modular. Look for patterns and repetitive code that can be simplified.
3. **Implement Abstraction**:
   - **Objects**: Define objects to represent key elements of the application, such as books, authors, and genres. Utilise the provided data (e.g., `authors`, `genres`, `books`) to populate these objects.
   - **Functions**: Create functions that handle repetitive tasks, such as rendering the book list, handling user interactions, and applying filters.
4. **Enhance Functionality**: Ensure that the application remains fully functional after refactoring. Test all features to confirm that users can still search, filter, and view books as intended.
5. **Documentation and Comments**: Throughout the refactoring process, document your code. Provide comments that explain the purpose and functionality of objects and functions.
6. **Adherence to Styleguides**: Ensure your code follows JavaScript and HTML coding standards and best practices for readability and maintainability.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- There are no areas of mastery in this project.

## Challenges faced

- Time-management = I spent a lot of time on this project and I wasn't sure whether I was going to meet the deadline or not.
- Putting my code blocks in order to maintain functionality.
- Abstracting my code by making new function names.

## Areas of Improvement

- Time-management = I need to set my schedule straight and adhere to it. Hopefully it'll put me back in line.
- Abstraction = I think more practice in abstraction will definetely refine my skills and next time I'll be able to abstract my code more easily.

# Overall Learning Experience

- It was somehow a tough and confusing project. It took me longer/ a lot of days to actually get what I need to do. The refactoring and abstraction process provided a more comprehensive and advanced learning experience, which my your understanding of various aspects of web development and I guess this is preparing me for more complex projects in the future.
